# Mark-down-Preview
I was doing a project in freeCodeCamp which said that I must build a mark down Preview.
Mark-down is defined as a is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. 
It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name
## User stories
Just like the previous project that I have created the mark down Preview had also the user stories that I needed to follow.
User Story: I can type GitHub-flavored Markdown into a text area.
User Story: I can see a preview of the output of my markdown that is updated as I type.

I was also given a package I can use to convert the text into markdown, but the package was not composary if you had a different package you were allowed to use it.

##  importing 
In order to start this project I used a my app file which I imported from the react tutorials
I then imported a library react as this was the labriary I was going to use to create my project.
I also imported the package marked which was recomended by freeCodeCamp in order for it to convert my text to markdown.

## index.js
This was my main file where I imported all the libraries that I was going to use.I had a class which I called a convert  which was going to render the id that I declared in my html.
