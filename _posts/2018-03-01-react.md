I have recently started learning about one of the javascript library which is react

## React
React is defined as an open source library to develope UI which is the (user interface) on web applications or site.
It uses a syntax called jsx,it is also fully component base.
The jsx syntax is not a requirement for react but it makes code more readable.

## Render()
A render() method  is implemented by react components that takes input data and returns what to display.
This method is the one that display things need to desplayed in the Dom.

##ReactDom
It is the glue between react an react-dom.
If you want to show your component to the the dom you need to use ReactDom.render method.
So that what ever you want to show in the Dom can be displayed.

##ReactNative
There is another method that react uses but most website do not support this Api yet.
React-native is similar to react the only difference is the way it is displayed in the dom..

## Conclusion
This the little research I have gathered about react in my next blog post I will write about react components and props.
