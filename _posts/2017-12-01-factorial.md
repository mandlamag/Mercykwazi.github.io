# Factorialize a Number
on Fridays I usually have assignments that I have to do after the assignments, I decided to do a little revision on the problem that I did in freeCodeCamp
which was at the begging of javaScript it was Introduction to JavaScript.
## The problem:
I must return a factorial of the provided integer.
### Conditions
If the integer is represented with the letter n,
a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

## Solution
When solving this problem I decided to test my new strategy of solving problems that I have started using.
## Step 1:
I first went and researched what a factorial function or number was, In my research, I found that a factorial number was, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n! is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
## Step 2:if-statement
After that definition, I decided to use an if statement and said that if any argument is passed and that argument is strictly equal to zero
then zero must be returned.
## Step 3:else statement
I then used an else statement and said if the first condition is not met the I said call the function again but when calling
the function you must reduce the number by 1 but multiply it by itself.

## Conclusion
The else statement was going to iterate until the first condition is met then my function was now working.
Doing this revision really helped me a lot to go back to brushing my recursion skills.
