### Spinal Tap Case tasks.

Solving the spinal Tap Case tasks was very challenging and seemed very impossible to complete.
I was able to solve majority of the test that were being handled on the code.
Problem was the few that I was not able to solve were the one's that kept me on my feet and struggling to solve the Problem.

Solving a part of the problem made me to be more attached to the problem and trying to solve it. The feeling of being close to solving a challenge restricts the considerations of other possible useful techniques.
I found myself always being victim of this. Being so close to solving the spinal tap case tasks made me to try by all means to get the current code I had to work and not change any major of minor thing.
I think this is why I am still trying to solve the challange.
