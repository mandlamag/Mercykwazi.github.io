# Symmetric Difference
## My story
This activity in freeCodeCamp was very challenging and I couldn't finish it.
I found this activity very challenging and I was failing to understand certain concerts that I will explain later. 

## The problem
I must Create a function that takes two or more arrays,
that function must  return an array of the symmetric difference.
## Symmetric Difference
It is the set of elements which are in either of the sets and not in their intersection. 
The definition of symmetric difference did not clearly explain what it was.
From the definition I got more confused that before because breaking down the definition,
In my own understanding a symmetric difference is let say you given two arrays the number that 
does not appear in both those arrays was the symmetric difference but there were other test scenario that carted
for numbers that appeared in both arrays as the symmetric difference,thats what confused me even more.
## How I approached the problem
Even though I wasn't sure what the problem wanted but I attempted the problem below is how I solved it:
## created a variable
I first created a variable which I assigned it to an empty array.
## for-loop
I knew I was dealing with arrays,so I knew that I need to loop through those arrays so I used a for-loop,I was given one parameter
so I knew that the arguments that would be passed will not be one but many so I used arguments
method.In  my for-loop I said loop through my arguments.
I then said my arguments index must be pushed to an empty array.
My empty array  now would contain an array of arrays that are passed as arguments.
### arguments
Arguments object is an array kike object corresponding the arguments passed to a function.
It is a local variable within a function.
It is refereed using the arguments objects.

## conclusion 
I knew that I had to create another function that will carter for the arguments that are passed but I need to do a little more research based on that.
