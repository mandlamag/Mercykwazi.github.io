# Pomodoro clock
After building a javaScript calculator,my next project was to build a Pomodoro Clock.
The pomodoro Technique is a time management method.
The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, usually 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. 
## User story
This app needed to fulfill the following stories:
The user can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.
He can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.
The user must be able to customize the length of each pomodoro.
## My approach
I found this project a bit challenging,today I spent most of my time trying to understand how the pomodoro really work.
Why it is useful 
I tried to map down the design on how I want my tomato to look like.
## Buttons
I knew that the user need need to start,pause and be able to restart the pomodoro.
So I created three buttons even though my buttons were not yet working but the plan was to create functions that will carter for this buttons.
## Conclusion
My app is far from being finished but I managed to get this far today.
