## My story
This activity in freeCodeCamp was quite challenging,I spent a lot of hours trying to solve it but at the end I managed to solve it.
## The problem
Return an English translated sentence of the passed binary string.

The binary string will be space separated.
## My solution
## First-step
I  created a variable Which inside it I splitted my string in it.
I then had a string which was splitted.
I also created an empty variable which I was going to use at a later stage

## Second step
I then created a for loop that will loop through the length of my string.
I then changed my string index i to charCode value then I changed that value to a binary value.
Which I then used the parseInt method that will convert the passed value into a decimal  which I set the index to value to so that it could return the string in a readable manner.
## Conclusion
Now that I changed the value to a more readable manner my function was now working.
