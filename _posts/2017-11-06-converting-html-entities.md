## what was required.
This task I was suppose to convert the given characters in a string to their corresponding HTML entities.
## My approach
In this task I did not struggle a lot in it because I found the task very easy to tackle.
The task said we needed to convert the characters into html entities.
### My first step
I first needed to understand what those entities are,In my research I found out that they are 
characters that are  reserved in HTML and they have special meaning when used in HTML document.

### My second step
I used the regex knowledge that I had to replace the given characters to their respective entities.
I created a variable  which I said it was equal to the whole of the string I was converting.
I used the replace method to replace whatever character I was given to html entities.
Then I returned my variable which I had created.

Then my function was working it replaced every string character.
In this exercise I leant different methods of using  regex.
