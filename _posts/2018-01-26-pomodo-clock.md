## Pomodoro clock
My last blog post which was two days ago, I wrote about the project that I was working on which is building a pomodoro  clock.
This assignment or project is a little bit challenging because there is a lot of context involved in it.
## The problem
As I mentioned in my previous blog post the project required the following:
The user can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.
He can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.
The user must be able to customize the length of each pomodoro.
## My approach
## Buttons
I knew that the user need need to start,pause and be able to restart the pomodoro.
So I created three buttons even though my buttons were not yet working but the plan was to create functions that will carter for this buttons.
