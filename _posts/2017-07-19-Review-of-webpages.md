# Review of web pages

-We reviewed each other web pages and codes.
-It was a very good exercise because I got a different perspective on how my Web page looked like.
-How I must improve it.What I can add and remove in my web-page.
-I also received feedback which was useful regarding my code.
-I got a feedback that I must change the style of my code,because  it was not in order.
-I thought that writing many line of codes with the same heading in my style was the good thing,
# My lesson

I leaned that Writing many lines of code,It made my code look messy instead.
