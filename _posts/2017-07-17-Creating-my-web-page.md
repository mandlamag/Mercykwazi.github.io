Last week was my first week with the coding ground.
I wasn't sure what to expect,but the week turned out better than I expected.
The thought of being taught something I have never done before was a bit scary,at the
same time mind-blowing because I was  going to be part of a journey that  I never traveled before.

I created my very first home page it was an amazing experience.
I also git pushing my very own home-page.
It felt good because I now know the process of doing it, I can confidently
say that I can now git push my work to my git page.I also got a better understanding on git as it own.
