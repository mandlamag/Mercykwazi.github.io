# Return Largest Numbers in Arrays
## My story
Yesterday I could not solve the cash-register problem at freeCodeCamp.
I still could not finish the activity so I decided to do a bit of revision on the things that I did on basic javascript so I chose to re-do the
return largest numbers of Arrays.
## The problem
I must return an array consisting of the largest number from each provided sub-array
the provided array will contain exactly 4 sub-arrays.
The following are the steps that I took to solve the problem:
## for-loop
I knew I was dealing with arrays so I knew that a for-loop would be a good choice to use for this problem
I used a for-loop to loop through the main array and then created a variable that I stored my index zero.
## for-loop
Still, inside my first for-loop, I created another for-loop that I said it should iterate through my new variable lengths.
## if-statement
Inside my second for-loop, I had an if statement that said that if my array i and my second for-loop  index was less than the variable,
then my variable was equal to both this two indexes.
## Conclusion 
Then I said that my variable was equal to the empty array that I first created 
I then return my empty array my function was now working.
