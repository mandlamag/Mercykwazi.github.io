# Multi-paradigm

Programming is divided into variouse paradigm which include the following:
#             Concurrent programming
It involves  multi-threding, support for distributed computing and message passing, It is usually done at the same time.
#              Actor programming
It involves concurrent computing with actors that make local decisioin in response to the environment, they are considerd selfish.
#             Data flow programming
Their main focus is to re-calculate  fomulers when there is a change in data values
#            Constrain programming
They place relations between variables as constrains(forced)
#          Declarative programming
Discribes actions that are done by programmers
#               Distributed programming
Support multiple autonomous computers that communicate via computers networks.
#              Functional programming
They use mathematical functions and avoid state and mutable data
#              Generic proggraming
They use algorithims written in terms of “to-be-specified” latter  type text that are then instantited as needed for specif types of provided as parameters.
#             Logic programming 
They use logical mathematical for programming.
#            Meta programming
Writting programs that manipulate other programs as their data
#            Template meta-programming
Templets are used by complies to genarat temporaley source code, which is merged by the complier within.
