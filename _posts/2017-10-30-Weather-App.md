Weather is the condition of the atmosphere,it could be cold,hot or rainy.
It is there-for important to know what the weather has install for you before you plan your trip or day.
In this projected we were to create a local weather app.

In this project I first needed to do a little research about API, how they work so that i could be able to finish my project.
I found APIs very interesting because they are the driving force of my app.
I first had to understand how to transfer information that is appearing on my weather api to be visible for people to be able to view it.
I first console.log the Api so that it could be easy for me to see what I could display for my user to see and what not to display for my user.
I had a function called data that contained information of the Api.

I had a container in my html that had a div,inside it I had an id  that will hold the information that I want to display for my users.
In order for the information to be displayed in a meaner that is presentable.
In my js section I used the id  that I had created in my Html to select what I wanted to be accessible for my users.
I also had a function that would convert the temperature from celsius to Fahrenheit,In case my user is at a location were they use Fahrenheit not celsius.
After creating that function I created a button in the html section  that when it is  clicked it  will display the conversion.

I used my css to style my weather App, I added a background colour to it and styled my heading which I called it " Your local weather".
I also styled my <p> element added a font-size, In my p element I wrote a brief description that would attract people to pay attention to my weather app. 

At the end  of this project I understood how Api work.
