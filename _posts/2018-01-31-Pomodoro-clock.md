# Pomodoro clock
A few days ago I wrote a blog post on the problem that was in freeCodeCamp,which I was still trying to solve or finish as it was a project.
## The problem
This project had the following user user stories.
The user can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.
He can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.
The user must be able to customize the length of each pomodoro.
## My approach
### Html
## Buttons
I knew that the user need need to start,break and stop the pomodoro.
The plan with this buttons was for the user to be able to start the time and be able to stop it or click the break button.
## Input-number
In order for my user to set the time they will need for the timer I created an input number table that I set the maximum time to be 30 minutes and the minimum to be 0,I did this so the user could not have to go above 30minutes in his work and not below zero because below zero this is a negative time.I also did the same for the seconds but set the maximum to 60 seconds.
I also added an id in my input number box so that I can be able to access the input number.

<td>
        <br> minutes
        <input type="number" min="0" max="30" id="minutes"></td>
      <td><input type="number" min="0" max="60" id="seconds"></td>

</td>

### JavaScript
In my javaScript side I did the following
## startTimer function
### if-statement
I had a function that will trigger the timer to start.
In the function I had a variable presentTimer that will display the present time and I could access it from html using an Id that was declared in html as "timer.
So I said that if the presentTime was strictly equal to   0:00 minutes then the time that need to be displayed was  0:00 minutes.
 if (presentTime === "0:00") {
        document.getElementById("timer").innerHTML = 0 + ":" + "00"
### else-statement
#### splitting the array
If the previous condition was not met I had an else-statement that had another variable that splitted the presentTime by the semicolon
var timeArray = presentTime.split(/[:]+/);
I then divided the splitted array into minutes and seconds.
I then said minutes were equal to splitted array index 0
 var m = timeArray[0];
Then seconds were equal to I then called my second checker function that I will explain later inside it I inserted [splitted array array index1 -1]
var s = checkSecond(timeArray[1] - 1);
###### if-statement
I then had an if statement that said if seconds were equal to 59, then minutes where equal to minute -1.
 if (s == 59) {
          m = m - 1;
        }
###### if-statement
I had another if-statement that said if both minutes and seconds were equal to 00 then my timer must be cleared up to minutes being 0 and seconds to 00
   if (m === "0" && s === "00") {
          clearTimeout(timer);
          m = "0";
          s = "00";
        }
###### Displaying the minutes and seconds
I then needed to display the format of the my timer so I used the document.getElementById() method and used the timer id.
I then specified that every 1000 milliseconds the timer must be started. 

        document.getElementById("timer").innerHTML = m + ":" + s;
        var timer = setTimeout(startTimer, 1000);

## startYourTimer function
I had a function that will start the timer that the user has set.In order to access the number of minutes the user has set. I used the id that I had set in my input number.
The minute the user set their time they need for their timer it is stored in this function.I then used the timer id to display the time.
I then called the startTimer function so that when ever the user can click the start button the start timer could be called.
   function startYourTimer() {
      var minutes = document.getElementById("minutes").value;
      var seconds = document.getElementById("seconds").value;
      document.getElementById("timer").innerHTML = minutes + ":" + seconds;
      startTimer()
    }                                                                                              
## checkSecond function
I had another function that checks the number of seconds that are passed.
It had an if statement that said if seconds where greater or equal to zero and seconds were less that ten then seconds were equal to 0 plus that second so that when it does a count down it adds a zero eg 10,09,08...
I then had another if statement said that if seconds were greater than zero then sec =60,so that it can start counting from sixty seconds.
I then returned the seconds.                                                              
function checkSecond(sec) {
      if (sec < 10 && sec >= 0) {
        sec = "0" + sec;
      }
      if (sec < 0) {
        sec = "59";
      }
      return sec;
    }  
## stop function
  I then created another function that stop's the timer when ever the user clicks the button. I  assigned to 0 minutes and 00 seconds, when ever the user clicks the button it stops the whole timer and return it to 0:00.
        function stopButton() {
      document.getElementById("timer").innerHTML = "0:00";
    }
                                                                                          In my html I used the on-click method to be able to access the functions in javascript side.
## Css
I then used css to style my project I used a box to display the timer which I set as a div class.
.boxed {
width: 300px;
    border: 15px solid ;
    padding: 25px;
    margin: 25px;;

}                                
# Conclusion 
My project was complete and working this project helped me to understand the javascript on-click method and also realized that you can call another function in another function the same way I called the start timer function in  startYourTimer function.


