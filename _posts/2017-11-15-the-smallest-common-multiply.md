## The task
The task that I was doing in freeCodeCamp was to Find the smallest common multiple of the provided parameters.

The same multiple has to be evenly divided by both parameters given.

The multiple should also be divided by all the sequential numbers in the range between those numbers.

The numbers given are not sorted.

## My approach
###  theory
I could not finish this task on time but there are a few things that I observed based on this activity
My first approach to this activity was to first to research what where.

### Creating  my first function 
I first created a function that checks the numbers in the range of the two given parameters.
I then gave my function two parameters x and y.
## my assumption
The reason I gave my function those parameters was because I assumed that in the given function I can be able to split the values,
Which was really useful nor correct.

### Creating my Second function 
I then created my second function.
Inside my second function I then created a variable which I assigned my array to it I then used the join method.
The reason for join method was so that I can be able split the given array so that it could carter for first function.

## 
My function was not working and I later discovered that my first function wasn't really necessary for me to have in the first place.
I then re-did my whole code:
## deleted my function
I deleted my first function because I found a new way of getting the numbers that are in the range of the first and last number given.

## Created new variables
I then created a two variables that I assigned it to index 0 and index 1;

## Conclusion
My function was not working but I have an idea how  to fix it.
