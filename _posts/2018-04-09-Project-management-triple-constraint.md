# Project Management Triple Constraint
Today I came across this interesting model called Project Management Triple Constraint
Is based on the following principals:
### Projects must be delivered within cost
When ever you are doing a project you must not go above the budget
### Projects must be delivered on time
You must ensure that you meet the time frame that you set for your project
### Projects must meet the agreed scope â€“ no more, no less
You must work within the time frame
### Projects must also meet customer quality requirements
As much as you must work on budget but you must ensure that you project meets the requirement of the client
