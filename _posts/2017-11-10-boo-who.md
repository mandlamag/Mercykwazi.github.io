# Boo-Who
## What was required
Check if a value is classified as a boolean primitive.

It should return true or false.

## My own understanding 
This activity wanted to highlight the difference between boolean and boolean primitives.

## My approach
In this activity I just used a return statement to say if the object specified in the string is a boolean it should return true,
other than that it should return false 

## My conclusion
Then my function was perfectly working.
