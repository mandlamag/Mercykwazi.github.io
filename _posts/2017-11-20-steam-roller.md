# My story 
Well, a steamroller is a form of road roller â€“ a type of heavy construction machinery used for leveling surfaces.
The definition of a steamroller, in this case, is similar to what the activity is requiring.
This activity was quite difficult to tacky, I struggled a little bit before I solved the problem.
The problem

# The problem
The activity required that I must flatten a nested array.

You must account for varying levels of nesting. this means that if 
you are dealing with an array, then you need to flatten it by getting the value inside of the array.

# Approach
## first step
I created a variable which I assigned it to an empty array.
## second step
I then created a for-loop, which went to every index of the array.
## third step
Inside my for-loop I then created an If statement which I said that if the value passed is an array it must be pushed to an empty array and added a concat method.
## Conclusion 
I then returned my array then my function was now working.
