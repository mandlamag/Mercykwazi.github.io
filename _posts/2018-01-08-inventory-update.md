# The problem
This is my first blog post for 2018,It is about the problem I was solving rather I tried to solve in freeCodeCamp today.
I couldn't finish the problem but I managed to solve part of the problem today.
The activity requested that:
Compare and update the inventory stored in a 2D array against a second 2D array of a fresh delivery.
Update the current existing inventory item quantities (in arr1).
If an item cannot be found, add the new item and quantity into the inventory array
The returned inventory array should be in alphabetical order by item.

# My approach
I first wrote down the steps I was going to follow to solve the problem,In other words I had to break down every instruction to my own simple understandable manner
This  are the rules that I wrote down:
I was going to compare two (2D arrays) against each other the first one being the current inventory and the second one being the the new delivery.
