## This blog post is a recap of my journey,
Well now our days things a little different than before.
Before I used to struggle a lot before I could solve an problem in freeCodeCamp.
Now I can manage to look at the problem and have an Idea on how I was going to solve it.

Looking back I think I really improved a lot.
My typing is even way better than before,my problem solving skills have also improved a lot from how they were at the before.

I previously wrote a blog post on how I was going to improve from my last activity that I was going to go back and do a lot of revision which I did and I can really say that I see the results of my revision.

I did a lot of revision on things I did before so the exercises I did before that I could not understand I now understand them very well.The perfect example is using a for-loop and if-statements I was struggled a lot understand how the two method worked,but as I gave my self time to understand them,Now I can use both these methods perfectly so.

## Conclusion
My journey is still continuing and I'm even more exerted on how I wil end up and I take each day as a learning experience and absolve every thing I come across.
