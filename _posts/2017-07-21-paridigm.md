Programming is divided into variouse paradigm which include the following:
               Concurrent programming
It involves  multi-threding, support for distributed computing and message passing, It is usually done at the same time.
               Actor programming
It involves concurrent computing with actors that make local decisioin in response to the environment, they are considerd selfish.
               Data flow programming
Their main focus is to re-calculate  fomulers when there is a change in data values
               Constrain programming
They place relations between variables as constrains(forced)
              Declarative programming
Discribes actions that are done by programmers
              Distributed programming
Support multiple autonomous computers that communicate via computers networks.
              Functional programming
They use mathematical functions and avoid state and mutable data
              Generic proggraming
They use algorithims written in terms of “to-be-specified” latter  type text that are then instantited as needed for specif types of provided as parameters.
             Logic programming 
They use logical mathematical for programming.
             Meta programming
Writting programs that manipulate other programs as their data
            Template meta-programming
Templets are used by complies to genarate temporaley source code, which is merged by the complier within.
