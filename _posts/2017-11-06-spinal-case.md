## What was needed
This activity required me to Convert a string to spinal case,
To change all -Uppercase case letters into lowercase-words-joined-by-dashes.

## My approach
I couldn't finish this activity I straggled to understand a few concept concerning this task
I first changed every string into a lowercase.
Then I tried using a regex to replace every white space with a dash and were there were under-score symbols I replace with a dash.

 ## My struggle
 I was struggling to put a dash before the changed Uppercase words.

  ## My lesson 
  This activity thought me to first right down my rules before I write my code down,
  I had missed the point that said that if I change a word to a lowercase I have to put a dash before it.
