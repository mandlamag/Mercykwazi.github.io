## The task
The task that I was doing in was to sum all the prime numbers up to and including the provided number.

## My approach
### My first-step -theory
My first approach to this activity was to first to research what prime numbers were.
A prime number is a number that is divisible only by itself and 1 and does not leave a reminder.

### My second -step
From the definition that I got I  already had a clue on how I was going to solve my problem.

### Creating  my first function 
I first created a function that checks whether the value passed to it was a prime number or not.
I did this so that it could be easy for me to check whether the value passed in was a prime or not.
####           for-loop
Inside my function that checks whether the passed value is a prime I had a for-loop that i set my i to be less the the number passed.
#####           if-statement
Inside my for-loop I had an if statement that returns false if the number divisible by i ===0 otherwise remain false.

### Creating my Second function 
I created my second function.
### variable
I created a variable which I assigned it to 0;
###             for-loop
Inside my second function I created a for-loop that checks that the I set it to x and x must always be less or equal to value passed.
#####           if-statement
Inside my if-statement I had a statement that used the first function to check if x was a prime if it is,it should be added to my variable which,
I had assigned it to 0

## Conclusion
I then returned my variable.My function was now working.
