# Software-development

I have lent about Agile software which promotes team work because it believes 
working together easily gets the job done rather working alone.
It also except change versus completion, It acknowledge a room for change when building  software versus the hunt for completion.

The  customer who funds the project must be made a valuable member of the team during
the process of development so that when there any changes you have made as the developer 
you can notify him/her.
In most cases programmers end up building a systems that not solve the problem because they end up being clueless on why they are building that specific software because they did not ask the customer those important questions.

# Conclusion

-Design is more expensive and needs a team of expect to draw a design.
-A  creative mindset is needed during design process.
-Construction is much cheaper than design,but constructors also face problems
 that might have overlooked during the design process.
-In most cases design does not carter for a budget so the amount is estimated
 then constructors are left to deal with a design which is worth a huge amount that is not in the budget.
